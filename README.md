Hello everybody there, my name is Andrei Shevchenko.

I am interested in embedded software development and safety in automotive world.

Now I am learning data fusion, Kalman filters, and other topics that can be useful in automotive.

I do not think at the moment a full-fledged autopilot for an ordinary car is possible. However we can prevent car incidents using modern technologies.
